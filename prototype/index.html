      <p>Without further delay, let's begin.</p>

      <h3>Who is Gordo?</h3>

      <p>Gordo was a South American species of squirrel monkey. he stoof over one foot tall and weighed between a sizeble 1 and 1.5 kg. He was one of the first monkeys to be sent into space via <em>NASA's</em> space program. Gordo as well as many primates, but <strong>ESPECIALLY</strong> members of his species, share similar structure to us humans. This made gordo a prime canadite for the service. Gordo was given the nickname <strong>Old Reliable</strong>.</p>
      
      <h4>The one's who came before</h4>

        <p>Gordo was not the first monkey to have been sent into space, but he is, by far, one of the most famous. The monkey's that had flown before albert were:</p>

        <ul>
<li>4 monkeys that were named albert</li>
<li>a few monkeys named Patricia</li>
<li>and a few monkeys named Mike</li>
 </ul>

      <p>By 1962, these monkeys had all been flown and had their data gathered for research.</p>

      <h5>Author's note for subsection</h5>
      <p>If you're really intrested, i'd definitly reccomend doing you're own research into the space monkey program from the 60's. It's really intresting seeing mankind's early approach and ventures into space travel.</p>

      <h3>The Flight</h3>
      
      <p>In December of 1958, Gordo was placed into a rocket, the PGM-19 Jupiter. The rocket was initially a ballistic missle re-developed into a rocket for testing. The flight was set to take off from Cape Canaveral</p>

      <dt>Flight Details for Jupiter AM-13</dt>
      <dd>Launch Location: Cape Canaveral, Florida</dd>
      <dd>Depature Date: December 13, 1958</dd>
      <dd>Depature Time: 03:53 Eastern Time</dd>
      <dd>Flight Time: 15 minutes</dd>
      <dd>Distance Traveled: 15,000 miles</dd>
      <dd>Apogee: 310 Miles</dd>
      <dd>LZ: South Alantic</dd>
    </dl>

      <p>The flight last for 15 minutes, during the time, Gordo was able to acheive a state of weightlessness for 8.3 minutes. Sadly, however, Gordo would lose his life on the return trip. His pod's parachute had failed to deploy, causing him to plummet at a speed of 10,000 mph (more than 13 times the speed of sound). Gordo was belived to be a;ive at the time of impact. </p>

      <h3>The Legacy</h3>

      <blockquote>We all heard the rumors that they want to send a monkey up first. Well, none of us wants to think that they're gonna send a monkey up to do a man's work ... what they're trying to do to us is send a man up to do a monkey's work. <cite>Deke Slayton, Mercury Seven Astronaut</cite></blockquote>

      <p>Although Gordo did tragically lose his life, the data gathered from him was nothing short of invaluable. <em>NASA</em> scientists had their information about acquired and could start further working towards humans in space. Gordo and his mission were essential players in the space race, and for that we should give credit and remeberance for the fallen yet reliable Gordo.</p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

      <p>Gordo was a primate destined for greatness. He helped pave the way for space travel and for the inevtible triumph of man in space. Scientists always knew that they could count on "Old Reliable" to get the job done.</p>
