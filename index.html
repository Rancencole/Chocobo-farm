<h3>Thoughts on Web Accesibility</h3>
<p>I belive Web Accesibility is a very important part of the modern internet experience. The appeal of the internet is the fact you can communicate with anyone, anywhere, anytime. With the internet, there's a sense of unity. Currently, according to Monsido.com/web-accesibility, over 15% of the world's populations have disabilities. The most common disibilities are related to visual and hearing dissibilities. These limitations can lead to so many people being limited in their online experience as a user. Which is why it's so important to alot time to focus on them and their struggles. Reseach dedicated to helping improve the user experience, such as detalied "ALT" text read out by speeking programs for those with visual impairments.</p>
<p>Web Accesibility is an important from a buisness perspective as well. It's bad if there are people being restricted or limited from your products. A quote from elaborates: </p>
<p>"Accessible websites can have better search results, reduced maintenance costs, increased audience reach, and demonstrate corporate social responsibility (CSR). Therefore, having a well-designed, accessible website doesnâ€™t just make your website available to those with disabilities, but it can also significantly improve the user experience for all users of your site" (Monsido.com)</p>
<p>In short, Web Accesibility is a very important aespect of the online landscape, and hopefully there will continue to be growing efforts to create a truly seemless experience for all users.</p>
