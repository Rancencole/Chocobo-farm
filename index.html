<h3>Thoughts on Web Accesibility</h3>
<p>I belive Web Accesibility is a very important part of the modern internet experience. The appeal of the internet is the fact you can communicate with anyone, anywhere, anytime. With the internet, there's a sense of unity. Currently, according to Monsido.com/web-accesibility, over 15% of the world's populations have disabilities. The most common disibilities are related to visual and hearing dissibilities. These limitations can lead to so many people being limited in their online experience as a user. Which is why it's so important to alot time to focus on them and their struggles. Reseach dedicated to helping improve the user experience, such as detalied "ALT" text read out by speeking programs for those with visual impairments.</p>
<p>Web Accesibility is an important from a buisness perspective as well. It's bad if there are people being restricted or limited from your products. A quote from elaborates: </p>
<p>"Accessible websites can have better search results, reduced maintenance costs, increased audience reach, and demonstrate corporate social responsibility (CSR). Therefore, having a well-designed, accessible website doesnâ€™t just make your website available to those with disabilities, but it can also significantly improve the user experience for all users of your site" (Monsido.com)</p>
<p>In short, Web Accesibility is a very important aespect of the online landscape, and hopefully there will continue to be growing efforts to create a truly seemless experience for all users.</p>
<h3>Progressive Enhancement</h3>
<p>Progressive Enhancement is a web term used for the practice of creating code with the intention of bringing it to as many people as possible. https://www.freecodecamp.org summarises PE with "it gives us basic user experience and cross compatibility across browsers to ensure stability." As time moves on, browsers begin to become decommissioned or unsupported over time. PE idealizes the aespect of ensuring stuff like basic content and web functionality should be accesible and working on all type of browsers to ensure a streamlined experience.</p>
<p>PE can be split up itno 3 different catagories, sort of like a peanut M&M. Theres your main course, the peanut (Initial HTML), your candy coating (External CSS) and finally your candy shell (Javascript). These all work together in PE to creat a unified web page workflow to ensure functionality across all browsers. I personally believe it is increadibly important to keep practicing PE. It's an overall easier endeavor that allows web developers an easier time to create their websites with a PE design philosophy. No need to create seperate HTML or CSS for different browsers, have a simple system thats effective across all browsers. It's good for buisness as it allows consumers across the internet to access web pages regardless of the browser, and it allows the web developer to experience a relif of stress. /p>
